```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue #1: Dashboard Authentication Error
**Problem:** `InvalidOperationException: User not found` on Dashboard access  
**Root Cause:** Missing user authentication check  
**Solution:** Added proper `_userManager.GetUserAsync(User)` validation with error handling  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue #2: Uncontrolled Database Seeding
**Problem:** Database was being emptied and re-seeded on every application start  
**Root Cause:** `SeedData.InitializeAsync()` called unconditionally in `Program.cs`  
**Solution:** Removed automatic seeding, implemented admin-controlled seeding via DatabaseManager page  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue #3: ProgressService Dependency Injection
**Problem:** `InvalidOperationException: Unable to resolve service for type 'CyberSecurityTraining.Services.ProgressService'`  
**Root Cause:** Constructor was injecting concrete `ProgressService` instead of `IProgressService` interface  
**Solution:** Updated constructors to use `IProgressService` interface throughout the application  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue #4: Lesson Completion NullReferenceException
**Problem:** `NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` when marking lessons complete  
**Root Cause:** Module not loaded in POST handler, causing null reference when accessing lesson data  
**Solution:** Added `LoadLessonsAsync()` call in `OnPostMarkLessonCompleteAsync` method  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue #5: Quiz Retake Routing Error
**Problem:** "Page not found" error when clicking "re-take quiz" button, incorrect URL generated  
**Root Cause:** `QuizResult.cshtml.cs` was redirecting with `moduleId` and `lessonId` parameters, but `TakeQuiz` page expects `id` parameter  
**Solution:** Changed redirect to use `new { id = result.Quiz.Id }` instead of moduleId/lessonId  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue #6: Certificate Page Missing
**Problem:** 404 "page not found" error when accessing `/Training/Certificate?moduleId=25`  
**Root Cause:** Certificate link existed in Dashboard but no Certificate page was implemented  
**Solution:** Created complete Certificate page with preview and PDF download functionality  
**Status:** RESOLVED
